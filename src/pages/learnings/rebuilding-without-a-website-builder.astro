  <h1>Breaking Up With My Recurring Subscription to Squarespace</h1>

<p>
  I wanted to rebuild my site so I could play with the wealth of tools to demistify how things work - and end a recurring subscription along the way. 
</p>

<p>
  I originally built my personal site on Squarespace in January 2021, a few weeks
  after getting accepted into Wharton. At the time, it felt like a grown-up step:
  a clean, polished place on the internet that signaled I was serious and put
  together.
</p>

<p>
  This rebuild was also to leverage AI coding tools in a way that helped me understand how things work,
  removing the cost of a recurring subscription for a very basic site, and
  giving myself more flexibility to extend it over time.
</p>

<p>
  I had also started running into limits with Squarespace when trying to host
  projects I built elsewhere, including a project I made using Bolt. Rebuilding
  the site myself gave me the freedom to integrate those projects directly,
  without fighting the platform.

  <h2>How I approached the rebuild</h2>
<p>
  I scoped the rebuild with ChatGPT to understand what tools I would need and
  what I could ignore.
</p>

<p>
  I sanity checked the plan with an SDE friend to make sure I was not adding
  unnecessary complexity.
</p>

<p>
  I spent about two hours setting up the scaffolding. This included VS Code,
  Astro, Netlify, and moving the site hosting off Squarespace.
</p>

<p>
  Once the foundation was in place, I came back to focus on the content. That
  part was fun and creative in a way the setup work was not.
</p>

<h2>Tools and setup</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Astro</strong> for static site generation and layouts</li>
  <li><strong>Markdown</strong> for writing and organizing content</li>
  <li><strong>Vanilla CSS</strong> for layout and visual decisions</li>
  <li><strong>GitHub</strong> for version control</li>
  <li><strong>Netlify</strong> for hosting and deployment</li>
</ul>

<p>
  I used AI as a support tool to help me understand unfamiliar concepts and debug
  issues. I did not use it to make architectural decisions for me.
</p>

<p>
  The hardest part was not syntax. It was building a clear mental model of how
  the pieces fit together and deciding what level of structure was enough.
</p>

<p>
  Working in VS Code felt less intimidating than I expected. It reminded me
  that coding is mostly writing and organizing files. It is not that different
  from building a Tumblr theme, just with better tools.
</p>

<h2>What this unlocked</h2>

<p>
  Once the scaffolding existed, continuing felt straightforward. I was no
  longer blocked by the platform.
</p>

<p>
  Rebuilding the site was not a big leap. It was a small set of decisions that
  made the site easier to understand and easier to extend.
