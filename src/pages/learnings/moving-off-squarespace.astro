  <h1>Breaking Up With My Recurring Subscription to Squarespace</h1>

  <p>
    I built my original personal site on Squarespace in January 2021, a few weeks
    after getting accepted into Wharton. At the time, it felt like a grown-up
    step — a clean, polished place on the internet that said I was serious and
    put together.
  </p>

  <p>
    Years later, moving off Squarespace wasn’t about building something more
    impressive. It was about building something I actually understood — and
    stopping myself from paying a recurring subscription for a very lightweight
    site.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-top: 24px;">
    The images capture the shift better than words. The first site optimized for
    polish and credibility. The new one reflects something I’ve learned since
    then: I can do hard things, and I don’t need to pretend I’m finished.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin-top: 32px;">How I approached the rebuild</h2>

  <p>
    I didn’t start by coding. I started by scoping. Instead of “rebuild my
    website,” I asked: what’s the smallest viable version of this that would be
    meaningfully better than Squarespace?
  </p>

  <p>
    Before committing, I sanity-checked the plan with two SDE friends offline.
    Not to ask them how to build it, but to make sure I wasn’t letting AI
    overcomplicate something that should stay simple. Their feedback was
    reassuringly boring: keep it lightweight, avoid premature complexity, and
    just start.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then I gave myself one uninterrupted hour. A hard stop. No polish, no
    optimizing — just enough time to get something real running locally.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin-top: 32px;">
    Tools, architecture, and technical decisions
  </h2>

  <p>
    This was my first time building a site this way, so I chose tools that were
    modern but intentionally simple.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Astro</strong> for static site generation and layouts</li>
    <li><strong>Markdown</strong> for content (Learning, Builds)</li>
    <li><strong>Vanilla CSS</strong> for layout and visual decisions</li>
    <li><strong>GitHub</strong> for version control and small, reversible changes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I used AI as a support tool — to explain unfamiliar concepts, debug issues,
    and sanity-check configuration choices — but not as the driver of
    architecture. Any time something felt complicated, I paused and asked
    whether the complexity was actually earning its keep.
  </p>

  <p>
    The hardest parts weren’t syntax-heavy. They were conceptual:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Understanding how Astro organizes layouts, pages, and content</li>
    <li>Deciding what deserved structure versus flexibility</li>
    <li>Resisting the urge to prematurely optimize</li>
    <li>Letting “good enough” ship so momentum could take over</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    By the end of the hour, the site loaded locally, navigation worked, and I had
    a mental model of how everything fit together. That was enough to keep going.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin-top: 32px;">What this unlocked</h2>

  <p>
    The biggest unlock wasn’t technical — it was psychological. Once the
    foundation existed, continuing felt easier than stopping. The site became a
    sandbox rather than a project with a finish line.
  </p>

  <p>
    Breaking up with Squarespace wasn’t a dramatic leap. It was a series of
    small, reversible decisions — and that’s usually how progress actually
    happens.
